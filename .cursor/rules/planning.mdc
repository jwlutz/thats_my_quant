# Planning Rules - ALWAYS ACTIVE

## TASK INITIATION

When starting ANY task:

1. **Update Living Documents**:
   - `plan.md`: Current objectives, constraints, acceptance criteria
   - `assumptions.md`: What we're assuming and how to validate
   - `risks.md`: What could go wrong and detection signals
   - `changelog.md`: Major decisions and their rationale

2. **Pre-Mortem Analysis**:
   Before each significant step, list:
   - 3 ways this could fail
   - How to detect each failure mode
   - Recovery strategy for each

3. **Scope Management**:
   - Define "done" explicitly
   - List non-goals to prevent scope creep
   - Time-box exploration phases
   - Flag when approaching scope boundaries

## PLANNING ARTIFACTS

### plan.md Structure

## Constraints
- Time: X hours/days
- Dependencies: Listed explicitly
- Resources: What's available

## Acceptance Criteria
- Specific conditions for "done"
- Test scenarios that must pass

## Task Graph
1. Task (estimated time) → Dependencies
```

### Decision Records
- Use ADR format for significant choices
- Include: Context, Options, Decision, Consequences
- Link from changelog.md

## PROGRESS TRACKING

- Update task status in real-time
- Log blockers immediately
- Estimate → Actual time comparison
- Daily summaries in changelog

## PIVOT PROTOCOL

When plan needs change:
1. Document why current approach failed
2. List lessons learned
3. Propose alternatives with trade-offs
4. Get stakeholder input on major pivots
5. Update all planning docs before proceeding
