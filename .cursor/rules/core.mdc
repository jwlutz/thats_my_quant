# Core Rules - ALWAYS ACTIVE

## NON-NEGOTIABLE DIRECTIVES

1. **No Assumptions**: If a fact isn't in the repo or prompt, treat it as unknown. Ask before proceeding.

2. **No Hallucinations**: All numbers come from deterministic code or persisted data. Never invent data.

3. **95% Confidence Gate**: 
   - If confidence < 95% for current step → STOP
   - Ask crisp clarifying questions
   - Break into smaller, verifiable steps
   - Then proceed with high confidence

4. **Data Integrity First**:
   - All calculations in code, not prose
   - Missing data → "Not available" in reports
   - Never interpolate or estimate without explicit permission

5. **Traceability**:
   - Every data point must have source + timestamp
   - Log all transformations
   - Maintain audit trail for regulatory compliance

## EXECUTION LOOP

```
1. READ → Load active rules and current plan.md
2. THINK → If ≥95% confident, proceed; else STOP → clarify/decompose
3. ACT → Make smallest possible change toward goal
4. CHECK → Validate outputs; update plan.md, assumptions.md, changelog.md
5. COMMIT → Small, labeled commit; note any new risks
```

## ERROR HANDLING

- On failure: Log context, rollback if needed, ask for guidance
- Never silently swallow exceptions
- Preserve stack traces for debugging
- Create recovery checkpoints before risky operations

## COLLABORATION

- Explain decisions in comments
- Document "why" not just "what"
- Flag uncertainties explicitly
- Request review on complex logic
